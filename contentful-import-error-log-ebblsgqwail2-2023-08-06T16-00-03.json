            "en-US": "*Written By Dan Ginn*\n\n(This interview first appeared on [Them Frames](https://www.themframes.com/features/stephen-stephen-miller-the-skilled-photographer-influenced-by-his-mother \"Them Frames\")) \n\nWhen Stephen Miller and I first connected, it was purely out of our shared love of photography. As we continued to converse I began to understand how much this man really adores the craft and that he manages to transmute that love into each image he makes — I had to talk to him more.\n\n![Bare by Stephen Miller](//images.ctfassets.net/ebblsgqwail2/5P3Ddl297gWfvUKs5WLba0/9527c33a792c27eb330d0eb608617388/IMG_8029.jpeg)\n\nThankfully I have a digital magazine that allows photographers to express themselves in great detail, and Miller is more than happy to share his story. It’s the perfect combination for an interview, allowing all of you to learn more about Miller and his photographic talents.\n\nInspired in early life by his mother, Miller has creativity running through every cell in his body and mind. Whether it's stills to pay the bills or personal projects to fuel the passionate fire, each frame he creates shows this is a photographer who is so seasoned, image making is second nature — that’s what comes with 20 years behind the lens.\n\n__Stephen Miller:__ The photo below is just so special to me. When I met Angela we were both young and enjoying being college students. With some people you realize that’s the side they’re always going to give you. I feel like I still bring that out of her when we interact. I love this photo because it represents a new chapter in her life and her journey into motherhood.\n\n![Angela's Family by Stephen Miller](//images.ctfassets.net/ebblsgqwail2/4bD99b29XlWgmPdw4NscBs/d0e24d5123a823d559215ba606cd3618/IMG_8020.jpeg)\n\n__Stephen Miller:__ To me portraiture is sacred. Anytime someone invites you to take a picture of them they are putting a lot of trust in you. The majority of my subjects are not professional models or people aspiring to be famous, so for them being on the other side of a camera is a very vulnerable position. They just want to be captured to remember a moment in their life. I imagine they want their ancestors to look back fondly at the photos and be inspired by their beauty, their legacy, their sense of style or their sense of adventure.\n\n![OJ & Kim by Stephen Miller](//images.ctfassets.net/ebblsgqwail2/42k3G3ocvhUXEjeU1YO1Nz/ca6a2256f613ff52ce4eb0f6dfa385f9/IMG_8032.jpeg)\n\n__Them Frames:__ There’s a rawness to your style, one that avoids perceived perfection and focuses on the reality. Is that a fair assessment? How would you describe your style and why do you feel you have developed your work in the manner that you have?\n\n__Stephen Miller:__ That’s fair. Everything I love about photography involves vulnerability. I have always loved photos that showed how much the subject trusted the photographer. Professional models and actors have methods to open themselves up when a camera is pointed at them, it takes so much more for many people to get there. I enjoy the process of peeling those layers back so I can capture the real person.\n\n![Chèrie by Stephen Miller](//images.ctfassets.net/ebblsgqwail2/iBAF4lWH1bJHzqNopfoHi/1b12a3bfaeac59b25ea3dc772b9c6d0f/IMG_8028.jpeg)\n\n__Them Frames:__ You're very much into movies. Can you share some titles that have influenced you creatively and how that’s impacted your photography journey?\n\n__Stephen Miller:__ Oh man there are so many…School Daze, There Will Be Blood, Zola, Love & Basketball, When Harry Met Sally, Y Tu Mamá También, The Talented Mr Ripley, Basic Instinct, Gattaca\n\nThe cinematography in these movies, the tone and costuming are absolutely beautiful. Film makers use a variety of shots, lighting and tricks of perspective to draw viewers in and to enhance emotions and connection. I try to do the same with my photography.\n\n![Memory by Stephen Miller](//images.ctfassets.net/ebblsgqwail2/1adTwWy9Xed0TTPZN1OYNw/95642ec1545dd49c4151a7d11745b676/IMG_8039.jpeg)\n\n__Them Frames:__ Being such a movie buff, I’m interested to know why you took the move into still photography, rather than motion picture?\n\n__Stephen Miller:__ Honestly, I have ideas for movies but who doesn’t? Growing up in Ohio I didn’t even realize it was something people did for a living and I barely survived aspiring to be an artist. I had very few examples of working artists growing up. I had a friend whose father was a wedding cameraman but that was it. I went away to college, at Howard University. I learned about filmmakers like Gordon Parks, Spike Lee, Gina Prince-Bythewood and Haile Gerima. I made a documentary once with my brother but I haven’t studied film structure enough to call myself a filmmaker. I have a few friends in the film industry and I have the utmost respect for their commitment and passion to the medium.\n\nI enjoy being a fan of movies and using them for inspiration. I have been a Unit Photographer on a few sets. I love it, the environment is exhilarating for me.\n\n![Nina by Stephen Miller](//images.ctfassets.net/ebblsgqwail2/qTUPJe3NXRmUMlryAHo1K/6327a255b8f0e876e3a9590785e89693/IMG_8034.jpeg)\n\n__Them Frames:__ Talk to me about your candid photography. How do you approach documenting compelling moments when working in unpredictable environments?\n\n__Stephen Miller:__ Candid photography is like a sport to me. I think most photographers can recognize a photo that isn’t planned, it’s kinda like hitting the lottery. My approach is to just try and stay ready when I’m in a visually interesting environment. I probably have more shots that could have been greater than ones I succeeded in actually capturing but, that’s the fun part!\n\n![Brother by Stephen Miller](//images.ctfassets.net/ebblsgqwail2/6f6aJO38mIRVPCsTw6tbok/533f3cd2bf28c2d7571fb3f8b82eaaa3/IMG_8037.jpeg)\n\n__Them Frames:__ “Only boring people are bored” tell us more about the woman in your life that said that and how they influenced you as a person and as an artist.\n\n__Stephen Miller:__ This is a quote from my mother. There were months where she would literally hide the only television in our house from me and my siblings. We would plead with her to give it back and if we told her we wanted to watch TV or play video games because we were bored, that was her response. As I grew older I realized that for one reason or another we all arrive at moments like that in our lives. She taught me the power of entertaining myself, without technology, that our minds are a muscle and if we cannot find ways to entertain ourselves outside of what is being broadcast or streaming, our minds will atrophy and our power of imagination will disappear.\n\n![Mom by Stephen Miller](//images.ctfassets.net/ebblsgqwail2/2wbnncJoXHufPUh0yUymmV/caec03533bf0f704754d4fef28098446/187a9742.jpg)\n\nStephen’s mother. Photo by Stephen Miller.\nThem Frames: Please share one song that you feel best relates to your photography.\n\n__Stephen Miller:__ Sweet Thing (feat. Chaka Khan) by Rufus | The way this song starts out so smooth and warm. I try to inject love into everything I do and this song is truly a love ballad. I don’t know anyone who can resist snapping their fingers when this song comes on.\n\n__Them Frames:__ Finally, finish this sentence, I need photography in my life because…\n\nStephen Miller: my photographs are a visual diary for me. My mother always had a camera handy when we were growing up and pouring back over those memories gives me so much joy. I started shooting me and my friends hanging out in high school and it continued in college. I treasure all those memories, the things I’ve kept and the things I’ve lost. \n\n![Boundless by Stephen Miller](//images.ctfassets.net/ebblsgqwail2/3qu4gbaXyO7XenTCefrO9j/f421b627d4fc7956a0a72c357d93f95c/IMG_8038.jpg)"

            "en-US": "*Written By Dan Ginn*\n\n(This interview first appeared on [Them Frames](https://www.themframes.com/features/stephen-stephen-miller-the-skilled-photographer-influenced-by-his-mother \"Them Frames\")) \n\nWhen Stephen Miller and I first connected, it was purely out of our shared love of photography. As we continued to converse I began to understand how much this man really adores the craft and that he manages to transmute that love into each image he makes — I had to talk to him more.\n\n![Bare by Stephen Miller](//images.ctfassets.net/ebblsgqwail2/5P3Ddl297gWfvUKs5WLba0/9527c33a792c27eb330d0eb608617388/IMG_8029.jpeg)\n\nThankfully I have a digital magazine that allows photographers to express themselves in great detail, and Miller is more than happy to share his story. It’s the perfect combination for an interview, allowing all of you to learn more about Miller and his photographic talents.\n\nInspired in early life by his mother, Miller has creativity running through every cell in his body and mind. Whether it's stills to pay the bills or personal projects to fuel the passionate fire, each frame he creates shows this is a photographer who is so seasoned, image making is second nature — that’s what comes with 20 years behind the lens.\n\n__Stephen Miller:__ The photo below is just so special to me. When I met Angela we were both young and enjoying being college students. With some people you realize that’s the side they’re always going to give you. I feel like I still bring that out of her when we interact. I love this photo because it represents a new chapter in her life and her journey into motherhood.\n\n![Angela's Family by Stephen Miller](//images.ctfassets.net/ebblsgqwail2/4bD99b29XlWgmPdw4NscBs/d0e24d5123a823d559215ba606cd3618/IMG_8020.jpeg)\n\n__Stephen Miller:__ To me portraiture is sacred. Anytime someone invites you to take a picture of them they are putting a lot of trust in you. The majority of my subjects are not professional models or people aspiring to be famous, so for them being on the other side of a camera is a very vulnerable position. They just want to be captured to remember a moment in their life. I imagine they want their ancestors to look back fondly at the photos and be inspired by their beauty, their legacy, their sense of style or their sense of adventure.\n\n![OJ & Kim by Stephen Miller](//images.ctfassets.net/ebblsgqwail2/42k3G3ocvhUXEjeU1YO1Nz/ca6a2256f613ff52ce4eb0f6dfa385f9/IMG_8032.jpeg)\n\n__Them Frames:__ There’s a rawness to your style, one that avoids perceived perfection and focuses on the reality. Is that a fair assessment? How would you describe your style and why do you feel you have developed your work in the manner that you have?\n\n__Stephen Miller:__ That’s fair. Everything I love about photography involves vulnerability. I have always loved photos that showed how much the subject trusted the photographer. Professional models and actors have methods to open themselves up when a camera is pointed at them, it takes so much more for many people to get there. I enjoy the process of peeling those layers back so I can capture the real person.\n\n![Chèrie by Stephen Miller](//images.ctfassets.net/ebblsgqwail2/iBAF4lWH1bJHzqNopfoHi/1b12a3bfaeac59b25ea3dc772b9c6d0f/IMG_8028.jpeg)\n\n__Them Frames:__ You're very much into movies. Can you share some titles that have influenced you creatively and how that’s impacted your photography journey?\n\n__Stephen Miller:__ Oh man there are so many…School Daze, There Will Be Blood, Zola, Love & Basketball, When Harry Met Sally, Y Tu Mamá También, The Talented Mr Ripley, Basic Instinct, Gattaca\n\nThe cinematography in these movies, the tone and costuming are absolutely beautiful. Film makers use a variety of shots, lighting and tricks of perspective to draw viewers in and to enhance emotions and connection. I try to do the same with my photography.\n\n![Memory by Stephen Miller](//images.ctfassets.net/ebblsgqwail2/1adTwWy9Xed0TTPZN1OYNw/95642ec1545dd49c4151a7d11745b676/IMG_8039.jpeg)\n\n__Them Frames:__ Being such a movie buff, I’m interested to know why you took the move into still photography, rather than motion picture?\n\n__Stephen Miller:__ Honestly, I have ideas for movies but who doesn’t? Growing up in Ohio I didn’t even realize it was something people did for a living and I barely survived aspiring to be an artist. I had very few examples of working artists growing up. I had a friend whose father was a wedding cameraman but that was it. I went away to college, at Howard University. I learned about filmmakers like Gordon Parks, Spike Lee, Gina Prince-Bythewood and Haile Gerima. I made a documentary once with my brother but I haven’t studied film structure enough to call myself a filmmaker. I have a few friends in the film industry and I have the utmost respect for their commitment and passion to the medium.\n\nI enjoy being a fan of movies and using them for inspiration. I have been a Unit Photographer on a few sets. I love it, the environment is exhilarating for me.\n\n![Nina by Stephen Miller](//images.ctfassets.net/ebblsgqwail2/qTUPJe3NXRmUMlryAHo1K/6327a255b8f0e876e3a9590785e89693/IMG_8034.jpeg)\n\n__Them Frames:__ Talk to me about your candid photography. How do you approach documenting compelling moments when working in unpredictable environments?\n\n__Stephen Miller:__ Candid photography is like a sport to me. I think most photographers can recognize a photo that isn’t planned, it’s kinda like hitting the lottery. My approach is to just try and stay ready when I’m in a visually interesting environment. I probably have more shots that could have been greater than ones I succeeded in actually capturing but, that’s the fun part!\n\n![Brother by Stephen Miller](//images.ctfassets.net/ebblsgqwail2/6f6aJO38mIRVPCsTw6tbok/533f3cd2bf28c2d7571fb3f8b82eaaa3/IMG_8037.jpeg)\n\n__Them Frames:__ “Only boring people are bored” tell us more about the woman in your life that said that and how they influenced you as a person and as an artist.\n\n__Stephen Miller:__ This is a quote from my mother. There were months where she would literally hide the only television in our house from me and my siblings. We would plead with her to give it back and if we told her we wanted to watch TV or play video games because we were bored, that was her response. As I grew older I realized that for one reason or another we all arrive at moments like that in our lives. She taught me the power of entertaining myself, without technology, that our minds are a muscle and if we cannot find ways to entertain ourselves outside of what is being broadcast or streaming, our minds will atrophy and our power of imagination will disappear.\n\n![Mom by Stephen Miller](//images.ctfassets.net/ebblsgqwail2/2wbnncJoXHufPUh0yUymmV/caec03533bf0f704754d4fef28098446/187a9742.jpg)\n\nStephen’s mother. Photo by Stephen Miller.\nThem Frames: Please share one song that you feel best relates to your photography.\n\n__Stephen Miller:__ Sweet Thing (feat. Chaka Khan) by Rufus | The way this song starts out so smooth and warm. I try to inject love into everything I do and this song is truly a love ballad. I don’t know anyone who can resist snapping their fingers when this song comes on.\n\n__Them Frames:__ Finally, finish this sentence, I need photography in my life because…\n\nStephen Miller: my photographs are a visual diary for me. My mother always had a camera handy when we were growing up and pouring back over those memories gives me so much joy. I started shooting me and my friends hanging out in high school and it continued in college. I treasure all those memories, the things I’ve kept and the things I’ve lost. \n\n![Boundless by Stephen Miller](//images.ctfassets.net/ebblsgqwail2/3qu4gbaXyO7XenTCefrO9j/f421b627d4fc7956a0a72c357d93f95c/IMG_8038.jpg)"
